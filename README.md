# PC104 Low Cost OBC
This project provides the design of a low-cost On-Board Computer (OBC) tailored for the space sector. It follows the **PC104** form factor, a widely adopted standard in embedded systems, particularly for aerospace applications such as CubeSats and small satellites. The objective of this project is to offer a cost-effective, compact, and reliable computing solution for space-bound missions, with scalability and adaptability for various aerospace applications.
